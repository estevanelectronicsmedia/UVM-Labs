# UVM-Labs
UVM-Labs is a growing set of small, runnable Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) exercises I have compleated in SystemVerilog. 

This repo is my running log of small UVM problems Iâ€™ve solved while leveling up toward ASIC/DSP verification work. The goal is to build fundamental ASIC and DSP verification skills through focused labs that are easy to run and read. Each activity includes source code and a short README. This repository doubles as my professional portfolio and a reference for clean, reusable testbench patterns.
