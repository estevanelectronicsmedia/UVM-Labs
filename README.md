# UVM-Labs
UVM-Labs is a growing set of small, runnable Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) exercises in SystemVerilog. 

The goal is to build fundamental ASIC and DSP verification skills through focused labs that are easy to run and read. Each activity includes source code and a short README. This repository doubles as my professional portfolio and a reference for clean, reusable testbench patterns.
